This was a module completed during my University studies that focused on building on top of the Abertay University GEF framework to build an animation system.
THe goal was to be able to real animation data from JSON files for predetermined 3D models and 2D sprite sheets and correctly animatye and render them.
Lastly we also had to implement an inverse kinematic system for the 3D models.
